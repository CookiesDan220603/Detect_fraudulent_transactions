# Detect Fraudulent Transactions (1/2025 - 2/2025)

## Overview
This project employs Python for data cleaning and organization, focusing on analyzing fraudulent activity and developing predictive models to detect fraud in banking.

## Role
In this project, I take on the role of:
- Building machine learning models to predict fraudulent transactions in banking.

## Data Cleaning and Organization
- Utilize Python to clean the data by:
  - Handling missing values
  - Removing duplicates
  - Standardizing data formats

## Fraud Analysis
- **Analyzing Fraud Patterns**: 
  - Examine transaction data to identify patterns indicative of fraudulent behavior.
  
- **Model Development**: 
  - Create and train machine learning models to enhance the accuracy of fraud detection.

## Identifying Customer Segments
- **Performance Analysis**: 
  - Identify key customer segments at risk of fraud.
  
- **Campaign Recommendations**: 
  - Provide suggestions for targeted interventions to mitigate fraudulent transactions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data cleaning and machine learning model development.

## Conclusion
This project aims to enhance the understanding of fraudulent transaction patterns and improve detection strategies, ultimately reducing fraud risks in banking.
